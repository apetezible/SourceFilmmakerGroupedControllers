# SourceFilmmakerGroupedControllers
I think this version of the group controllers file is more comfortable to animate.

Just go to your Source Filmmaker directory, go to game>platform>cfg, and create a backup file of the original "sfm_defaultanimationgroups.txt".
Download mine and replace it... If you want to get the new grouping in an already imported SFM model: right-click it, go to Utilities, and click on Rebuild Control Groups. That should do it!
